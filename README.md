# Book Library

The **Book Library** is the reference example project for the
[AI Unified Process](https://unifiedprocess.ai) tutorial. It is built step by step throughout
the tutorial to demonstrate how to drive a real Vaadin and jOOQ application from requirements
to running code with the help of AI-assisted, disciplined engineering.

## About the AI Unified Process

The [AI Unified Process](https://unifiedprocess.ai) (AIUP) is a lightweight, AI-assisted
software process that combines proven practices from the Unified Process with modern AI tooling.
Rather than letting an AI agent improvise, AIUP guides it through clearly defined artifacts:

1. **Requirements catalog** – functional requirements (user stories), non-functional requirements,
   and constraints.
2. **Use case specifications** – detailed scenarios with main and alternative flows.
3. **Use case diagram** – PlantUML overview of actors and system boundaries.
4. **Entity model** – Mermaid ER diagram with attributes and validation rules.
5. **Flyway migrations** – versioned SQL scripts derived from the entity model.
6. **Implementation** – Vaadin views and jOOQ data access generated from the use cases.
7. **Tests** – Browserless UI unit tests and Playwright end-to-end tests.

Each step has a dedicated skill in the `aiup-core` and `aiup-vaadin-jooq` plugins. The tutorial
walks through using them in order to grow the Book Library from a blank canvas into a working
application.

## Technology Stack

- [Vaadin Flow](https://vaadin.com) for the server-side UI
- [jOOQ](https://jooq.org) for type-safe SQL and the data access layer
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/) as the application framework
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) as the database
- [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org) for schema migrations
- [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com) for jOOQ code generation and integration tests
- [Vaadin Browserless Testing](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/flow/testing/browserless) for UI unit tests
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) with [Mopo](https://github.com/viritin/mopo) for E2E tests
- [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org) for architectural rules

## Running the Application

Before running the application, the jOOQ metamodel has to be generated using the Maven plugin:

    ./mvnw compile

Then you can run the application with a database started by Testcontainers from your IDE using the `TestApplication`.

**Important:**
This class uses the [Spring Boot Testcontainers support](https://spring.io/blog/2023/06/23/improved-testcontainers-support-in-spring-boot-3-1/), introduced with Spring Boot 3.1.
Thus, [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [Testcontainers Cloud](https://testcontainers.com/cloud/) must be running on your local computer.

## Testing the Application

There are two base classes:

- `AbstractBrowserlessTest` can be used for fast [browserless testing](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/flow/testing/browserless), aka UI unit test. It extends Vaadin's `SpringBrowserlessTest`, which sets up a Vaadin mock environment without a browser.
- `PlaywrightIT` configures Playwright for E2E tests. This class uses SpringBootTest at a random port.

The Playwright test uses [Mopo](https://github.com/viritin/mopo), which simplifies the testing of Vaadin applications with Playwright.

## Deploying to Production

To create a production build, call `mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Windows),
or `./mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Mac & Linux).

This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources, ready to be deployed. You can find
the file in the `target` folder after the build completes.

Once the JAR file is built, you can run it using `java -jar target/book-library-<version>.jar`

## Project Structure

- `core/ui/layout/MainLayout.java` contains the navigation setup using [App Layout](https://vaadin.com/docs/components/app-layout).
- `core` package holds cross-cutting concerns: configuration, shared UI components, i18n.
- Feature packages (e.g. `greeting`) follow a `ui` / `domain` split so each use case stays self-contained.
- `src/main/resources/db/migration` contains the Flyway migrations that drive jOOQ code generation.
- `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources` contains the custom CSS styles.
